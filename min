Over the past few months, we have welcomed many new members to our community, launched exciting new initiatives, and continued to explore new ways to empower our members and create value for our stakeholders.

This week’s editorial features HiroKennelly discussing a proposal to create a Spanish-language subDAO within BanklessDAO. This subDAO will produce content aimed at Spanish-speaking people, of which there are over 500 million native speakers around the world. What an excellent way to further out mission to create onramps for people to discover the liberating power of decentralized financial technologies.

If you are looking to do your taxes quickly and for free (and who isn’t!?), Bankless Card has rolled out a new initiative that enables you to do just that. Taxman is a new feature that allows you to do taxes on DAO income in five minutes! Ready, set, file!

On the governance front, there are Snapshot and Forum proposals needing your comments and votes — go and make your voices heard! Season 8 budget proposals have been submitted to Forum for review by the Grants Committee.

This week’s Community Call finished with a roundtable discussion on the seasonal funding process. Many experienced contributors shared their views on existing obstacles, and suggested expectations and solutions regarding improvements.

Thank you for being a part of our DAO community, and we look forward to continuing to work together to build a better, more decentralized future. Have a splendid weekend!
